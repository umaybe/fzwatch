pub const Event = enum { modified };
pub const Callback = fn (context: *anyopaque, event: Event) void;
pub const Opts = struct { latency: f16 = 1.0 };

pub fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator) !Watcher;
pub fn deinit(self: *Watcher) void;
pub fn addFile(self: *Watcher, path: []const u8) !void;
pub fn removeFile(self: *Watcher, path: []const u8) !void;
pub fn setCallback(self: *Watcher, callback: Callback) void;
pub fn start(self: *Watcher, opts: Opts) !void;
pub fn stop(self: *Watcher) !void;
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```sh
zig build test
```
